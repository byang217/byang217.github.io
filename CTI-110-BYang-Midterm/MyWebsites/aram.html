                <p>
                    All Random All Mid, commonly referred to as ARAM, is one of the mini games that League has to offer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The objective of this game is similar to Summoner's Rift however, there's only 1 lane for all
                    players
                    to utilize, the mid lane.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is my favorite game mode because it focuses less on farming tactics and more on fighting the
                    enemy team.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition, ARAM games typically consume less time because of it's faster-paced nature.

                <p>
                    My 3 favorite champs to play in ARAM are Teemo, Kat, and Lucian
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Teemo, because he looks like an innocent champion but, has the potential to exert a lot of damage.
                    His mushroom traps are super annoying to walk into.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Katarina, because her play style requires a good amount of skill to be successful. However, she is a
                    very strong champion when played correctly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, Lucian. He is an ADC champion that also requires a good amount of skill. He has
                    a dash ability that is really fun to use to close the gap between enemies.
