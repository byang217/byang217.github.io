                    Teamfight Tactics or TFT is Riot's version of auto chess.

                <p>
                    8 players compete to acquire the best champions/items, strategically place them on the board, and
                    let the game simulate the action.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This game is a lot more relaxed and doesn't require any specific skills to play. Instead, the
                    ability to form a strong team and strategically place them on the board is the key to winning this
                    game mode.

                    Currently, League is on it's 9th tft set. Basically, that means they are on their 9th large revision
                    of the game mode. Every so often, Riot revises TFT with new champions, items and/or play style
                    mechanics.

                    Personally, I have not played TFT in awhile but my favorite comp to play from set 5 was the
                    "Forgotten Vayne" comp. With this line up, Vayne is the carry and the dominant trait, which provides
                    synergy to a certain team comp, is "Forgotten".
